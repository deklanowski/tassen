Introduction and Motivation
***************************

Focus on the Telco World.

* Telco operators have an interest in using datacenter technologies ->CORD

* Operators want disaggregation, but incumbent vendors make it hard by defining CUPS APIs that are ambiguous and make integration painful
* New methodology: formally specify the forwarding pipeline of telco appliances (BNG, UPF) to facilitate interoperability

* We are not the first to propose this approach (Google using it for their fixed-function datacenter switches)
* Tassen and UP4 as concrete examples of this methodology

Other:
* It would be good to collect experiences from other projects where P4 was not used, e.g. any issue with porting Voltha from the Edgecore OLT to others while using OpenFlow without a formal pipeline definition?
* Benu networks in implementing PFCP?
