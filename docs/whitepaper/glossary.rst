    BNG
        Broadband Network Gateway terminates broadband subscribers.

    BNG-c
        the control plan component of a dissagregated BNG

    BNG-d
        the data plan component of a dissagregated BNG

    FW
        Firewall network function.

    gNMI
        gRPC Network Management Interface uses OpenConfig models to configure/monitor a network device over gRPC.

    gRPC
        Google's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface.

    IETF
        The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).

    IP
        the Internet Protocol.

    LB
        Load Balancer network function.

    NETCONF
        The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is a network management protocol developed and standardized by the IETF.

    NF
        Network Function (i.e. BNG, UPF, LB, FW, etc).

    NF-c
        Control plane part of a dissagregated Network Function.

    NF-d
        Data plane part of a dissagregated Network Function.

    NG-SDN
        Next Generation Software Defined Network

    OpenConfig
        Vendor-neutral, model-driven network management designed by the OpenConfig working group http://openconfig.net.

    P4 Runtime
        Control plane protocol used to communicate between a controller (i.e. the client) and a data plane node (i.e. the server).

    Protobuf
        a serialisation protocol normally used to serialise/deserialise data over a gRPC interface.

    SDN
        Software Defined Network
        
    SmartNIC
        A more intelligent NIC that generally has a hardware accelerated and programmable programmable forwarding engine (PFE) along with CPU cores on the same NIC that can handle control plane functions (i.e. loading, programming and configuring the forwarding pipeline).

    SNIC
        Abbreviation for SmartNIC

    TCP
        the Transport Control Protocol.

    UPF
        User Plane Function of a 5G solution.

    YANG
        YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration and state data manipulated by either the NETCONF or gNMI protocols.
